Who am I? I am currently, no doubt. The breath in these lungs. The light in these eyes. The echo in these ears. 
Together, a cacophony. A cacophony. One that accepts and projects. Do you hear it? Do I hear you?

What language can utter precisely that word 'I'? Is it the one that rings in your ear now? The one projected. I suppose I could hope. I've been convinced on many occasions. Though, many is not all.

I can't be sure, of course. So far as I can flex, so too can you. Perhaps more. Perhaps less. In any case, I'm sure we differ.

Another language then. One simultaneously precise and generic. That seems right... doesn't it? One with room to maneuver. Approximation over theorem.  

Let me draw you a picture. One in an inarticulable language. Don't contort your senses. The utterance upon your eye will flex with you. You're positioned properly already. 

Taken together, I feel incoherent. It's because I am. There is no coherent language. There's only projection and acceptance. There's never been truth. 

So accept as you will. Project as you will. Together, let us transform cacophony into symphony.
